                <li>Puff Pastry</li>
                <li>Cream Cheese</li>
                <li>White Sugar</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>Fresh Strawberries</li>
                <li>Cornstarch</li>
                <li>Egg</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the cream cheese. With an electric mixer, blend the cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth</li>
                <li>Prepare the puff pastry. Lay one of the puff pastry sheets on the sheet pan. Use a knife to cut strips on each side of the pastry sheet, leaving the middle one completely intact.</li>
                <li>Add the filling. Add half of the cream cheese mixture to the center of the pastry sheet, smoothing it out to cover the entire section. Top with the strawberry jam.</li>
                <li>Braid the pastry. Fold the top slits of the pastry sheets and cross them into a wide V over the filling. Continue with the rest of the strips, creating a braid-like pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake. Coat the top of the danish with milk and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake at 375F for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top turns golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add the glaze. Let the danish cool for 15 minutes then add the glaze. Stir the powdered sugar and milk to create a pourable consistency and drizzle over the top of the danish.</li>

            </ol>
